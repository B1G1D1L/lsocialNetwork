![widgets-themed-bordered](https://feature-sliced.design/assets/images/widgets-628b4c80d4059c8ec5ef60fcb60d8a29.png)

## Description

This is usually where independent and complex page widgets are located, composing the underlying layers

> The layer was introduced as an experimental one to solve the existing problems when using other layers
>
> So far, no best practices have been developed for this layer (apart from those that apply to other layers), so use it only if necessary and consciously

## Can use

`shared`, `entities`, `features`
