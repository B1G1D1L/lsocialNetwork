# `Social-Netwok`

In this project, I learned how to use the React JS library. On the social network, you can find a person and subscribe to him. As the application grew, I added strong typing with the TypeScript library. For server requests I used api https://social-network.samuraijs.com/docs (to use this api you need to be registered on the site https://social-network.samuraijs.com/). 

## Other libraries were used in the project:

### `TypeScript`
### `Redux, React-redux`
### `React-Router`
### `Axios`
### `redux-form, formik`
### `Classnames`
